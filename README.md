###1, Database Management Notes

My notes on back-end development based on Database System Concepts, 6th edition, by Abraham Siberschatz, Henry F. Korth and S.Sudarshan. The topics include: basic SQL language, intermediate SQL operations such as join, view and integrity constraints, formal relational query language and the process from mathematical concepts to implementations, spatial optimization with normalization, query optimization based on the query tree, and runtime optimization by data structures including B+ tree and hash table.

###2, From ER Diagram to SQL script

The material I wrote for the professor of Database Management when I worked as a teaching assistant. It consists of very basic concepts and illustrations of how to convert a conceptual ER diagram to actual DDL and DML scripts in SQL, assited by MySQL workbench. It is naive but applied knowledge of back-end development for students.

###3, Algorithm Notes

My notes on Stanford CS 161: Algorithm, including: divide and conquer, randomized algorithms, graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming and miscellaneous topic such as NP-completeness and approximation. All algorithms consist of the design, the proof of correctness (or proof of probability of correctness) and the proof of runtime written by my own based on the class material.
